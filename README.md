#NLP-Project

This project focuses on developing a pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained models for the Uzbek language, enabling tasks like Speech-to-Text (STT) and Named Entity Recognition (NER).

The repository contains:

    Preprocess Datasets: The code for loading and preprocessing datasets is located in the preprocess_datasets folder.
    Training: Code for training pre-trained models on these datasets, along with instructions on integrating two models into a single pipeline, located in the training folder.
